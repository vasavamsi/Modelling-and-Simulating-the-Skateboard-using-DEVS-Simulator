# Modelling-and-Simulating-the-Skateboard-using-DEVS-Simulator
This project is completed as a part of assignment for CSE-561 Modelling, Simulation and Theory of applications. This work leverages the state-of-the-art DEVS simulator to develop the model for Skateboard Generator, Skateboard Transducer and Skateboard models. We also couple these models to create the couple model.
